    "text": "2.1.1 Benefits\nThere are a number of benefits to investing in templated or parameterised reporting:\n\nReduced repitition: Avoiding repetition of producing basic or standard analysis.\nBetter publication workflow:\nConsistency: Can provide greater confidence with results, with less chance of human error.\nCapability transfer: Analysis in a structured or templated format can be useful for knowledge transfer.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Headaches\nTemplated reporting is not without all faults.\nTransforming ad-hoc processes to more structured end to end reports can be quite an investment, particularly if users aren’t already using the processes. It is advisableot consider building a Quarto template of a report to be a capital investment. You spend the additional effort to build up the capability to develop reports quicker, more consistently and even automatically.\nAdditionally, there may be small hurdles in the processes that leave you with a publication gap. Things like specific formatting, unique organisation requirements on things like table of chart formats. This is particularly relevant when considering to choose a Word or PDF output. On one side, PDF outputs typically have cleaner and neater formats, with more tools for customisation, however, they are locked on completion (outside of some external PDF to Word tools). On the other side, Word outputs are inherently customisable for publications, but are typically generated in a less output-ready format.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto generated reports may fall short of the ‘publication’ version\n\n\n\n\nThese are important facotrs to conisder from a cost benefit perspective. The nature of Quarto and rendering may mean that there is a significant dependency or time investment for including specific features. In order to adopt the benefits of templated reports often mean sacrificing or making concessions on these certain elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto generated reports save time and minimise human error",

    "text": "About this\nThis is a book using Quarto for generating reports. These can range from parameterised and automatic reports, to draft reports halfway on the way to publication.\nThis books content was initially drafted during the 2025 OceaniaR Hackathon in Canberra. It spawned from shared experiences of users generating primarily internal reports, working through hurdles and tricks on working with dynamic text, parameterisation, and multi-output formats.\n\n\nWhy does it exist?\nThis book looks to distil principles for best practice and hot tips for dynamic/reproducible quarto coding. Some amazing Quarto resources are out there already, like Quarto for Scientists by Nicholas Tierney. This book will contribute to this pool of knowledge, providing some best practice principles for using Quarto in a functional and dynamic way.\n\n\nWho should read this\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to automate a report, or streamline a document or process. 🧰\nIf you are sick of copy pasting charts, tables between your output folder and the documents.\nIf you enjoy developing reproducible analytical pipelines, beautiful and functionalised visualisations, or creatively writing dynamic text. 📊\nYou’re a process or structured code savant who loves making structured and neat code! 🛠️",
