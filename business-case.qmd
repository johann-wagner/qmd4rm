## Templated reporting

There are a number of benefits to investing in templated or parameterised reporting:

-   Time saving: Avoiding repetition of producing basic or standard analysis.

-   Consistency: Can provide greater confidence with results

-   Capability transfer: Bundling analysis into a structured format can be useful for coll

That said it does not come without its costs. Transforming ad-hoc processes to more structured end to end reports can be quite an investment, particularly if users aren't already using the processes. It is advisableot consider building a Quarto template of a report to be a capital investment. You spend the additional effort to build up the capability to develop reports quicker, more consistently and even automatically.

Additionally, there may be small hurdles in the processes that. Things like specific formatting, unique organisation requirements on things like table of chart formats. From a cost benefit perspective, adopting these benefits may often mean sacrificing things like specific unique formatting requirements.

Templated reporting is not without all faults.
