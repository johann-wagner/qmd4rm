## Templated reporting

Avoiding repetition of producing basic or standard analysis. This has benefits from a time and cost saving perspective.

From a cost benefit perspective, this may mean sacrificing things like specific unique formatting requirements that Quarto cannot handle, accepting different table or chart formats.

Consider building a Quarto template of a report to be a capital investment. You spend the additional effort to build up the capability to develop reports quicker, more consistently and even automatically.

Templated reporting is not without all faults.
