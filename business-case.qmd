# The case for templating

## Templated reporting

### Benefits

There are a number of benefits to investing in templated or parameterised reporting:

-   **Reduced repitition:** Avoiding repetition of producing basic or standard analysis.

-   **Better publication workflow:**

-   **Consistency:** Can provide greater confidence with results, with less chance of human error.

-   **Capability transfer:** Analysis in a structured or templated format can be useful for knowledge transfer.

### Headaches

Templated reporting is not without all faults.

Transforming ad-hoc processes to more structured end to end reports can be quite an investment, particularly if users aren't already using the processes. It is advisableot consider building a Quarto template of a report to be a capital investment. You spend the additional effort to build up the capability to develop reports quicker, more consistently and even automatically.

```{r}
#| label: business-case
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Quarto generated reports save time and minimise human error
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","business-case.png"))
```
